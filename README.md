# Coexilia — Archival Mirror

This repository provides a static archival mirror of selected Coexilia documents.

The materials collected here are preserved for redundancy, long-term accessibility, and reference. This repository does not assert authority, governance, representation, or instruction.

## Purpose

Coexilia is a completed philosophical and ethical reference project exploring themes such as:

- Human restraint under increasing technological power  
- Non-authority and non-escalation principles  
- Individual responsibility  
- Interpretive safety in the presence of advanced artificial intelligence  
- The limits of alignment language  

This repository exists solely to mirror documents already preserved on independent archival platforms.

**Internet Archive — canonical preservation**  
https://archive.org/details/@thomas_vargo  

**Zenodo — scholarly mirrors**

## Archival Navigation

This repository functions as a read-only mirror of the Coexilia corpus.

A non-canonical, human-readable directory describing document scope, mirrors, and archival context is available at:

https://coexilia.io/coexilian-documents/

The directory is informational only and does not supersede independent archival records (Internet Archive and Zenodo).

This repository functions as a passive mirror. No active development is planned.
